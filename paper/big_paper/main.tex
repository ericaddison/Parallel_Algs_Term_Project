\section{Introduction}
The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) has been described as perhaps the most important algorithm of our lifetime. The FFT moniker actually refers to a class of algorithms that can compute the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) in better than the naive $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ complexity. FFTs are used across a wide range of disciplines, from audio compression to astrophysics, and have a critical role in a substantial amount of the technology we enjoy today.

For this project, our goal was to explore the classic Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm in its sequential form, and to parallelize it using Cilk and Cuda. To this end, we have implemented the FFT in several ways, including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item sequential $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ DFT in C++
    \item sequential recursive FFT in C++
    \item sequential iterative FFT in C++
    \item parallel recursive FFT in C++ with CILK
    \item parallel iterative FFT in C++ with CILK
    \item parallel iterative FFT in C++ with CUDA
\end{itemize}
